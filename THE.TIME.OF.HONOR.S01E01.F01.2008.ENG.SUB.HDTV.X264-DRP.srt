6
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,041
- Good morning, men!
- Good morning!

7
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,326
10 seconds late! As a reward,
ten additional rounds!

8
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,967
The first four, ten knee bends!
The rest...

9
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,282
assume the position!

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,009
Bobby is in a good mood today.

11
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,288
One... two...

12
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,563
- Will you manage Michał?
- Wanna bet?

13
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,525
- I'll take a bet.
- A vodka in Nowy Świat St.

14
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,530
- Is it a bet, Button?
- Don't call me “Button

15
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,929
- Eight, nine, ten!
- Second round.

16
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,361
Go! Go! And the next!

17
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,201
And the next one! Go! Go!
Higher!

18
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,802
Faster! Move it!
The next one! Go!

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,048
Go! Go! Go! Faster!

20
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,847
Go! Go! Go! Faster! Faster!

21
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,611
Stronger! Throw it stronger!

22
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,885
Go! Go! Go! Third round!

23
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,442
Go! Go! Go! The next one!

24
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,407
Let me remind you, that the most
important is the right hold.

25
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,331
Bring the hand down, hold the mouth

26
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,170
and cut!

27
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,569
- Bronek will show you.
- Yes, sir!

28
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,731
Hand, mouth, cut!

29
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,048
Very well! Next is Władek!

30
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,762
Hand, mouth, cut!

31
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,962
Good! Now Janek!

32
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,451
Hand, mouth, cut!

33
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,008
- Next is Michał!
- Father is coming!

34
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,243
Sergeant. I have to take my boys
immediately.

35
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,649
Yes, sir!
At ease! March off!

36
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,681
- Are we ﬂying?
- Yes.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,571
- Finally!
- At last!

38
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,489
Get in, Button!

39
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,490
- Go!
- You did well.

40
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,929
Well, gentlemen!
See you in Poland!

41
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,284
POLAND,
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF WARSAW

42
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,447
Everybody out!

43
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,769
Get out!

44
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,764
This is the end.

45
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,242
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee...

46
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,163
Take care.

47
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,642
Oberscharfuhrer, I've got something
important to say!

48
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,129
- What?
- I need to see captain Martin Halbe

49
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,402
- from the Abwehr.
- What?

50
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,401
Take me to captain Martin Halbe
or else tomorrow you'll take my place.

51
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,570
Can you hear me?

52
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,367
Bring him over here.

53
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,166
Why do they take him away?

54
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,690
I won't explain anything.

55
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,120
Drive me to captain Martin Halbe.
You won't regret.

56
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,641
Take him to the car!

57
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,050
- Son of a bitch.
- They won't shoot.

58
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,686
Fire!

59
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,004
For Germans only.

60
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,851
Come in.

61
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,204
It's not Paris here. I thought
that actors have a better life.

62
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,251
- Did you bring it?
- What you like:

63
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,886
Swiss chocolate,
cold cuts from Otwock...

64
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,243
- No, thank you. Do you have it?
- of course.

65
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,725
Most real potassium cyanide.

66
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,326
Have you heard the news?

67
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,286
Our troops will be parachuted
from England to Warsaw.

68
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,720
They are to blow trains,
organize guerrillas in the forests.

69
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,402
Probably they killed Mr. Sym.

70
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,611
- Finally, something is happening.
- Here. As we agreed.

71
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,606
It's been a pleasure.
Maybe I'll become an artist, too?

72
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,410
- Go. Curfew begins soon.
- All right. I'm gone.

73
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,446
I commend myself to your memory.

74
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,127
MARCH 1941,
OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL

75
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,764
Can't believe tomorrow
we'll be in Warsaw.

76
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,210
I'll walk down Nowy Świat.
The most beautiful girls are there.

77
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,882
Tomorrow you'll be waiting
till they pick you up.

78
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,731
But at home.
I'm fed up with England.

79
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,810
Though English girls
are very hospitable.

80
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,280
- Can't see anything.
- It must be dark in Warsaw.

81
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,719
- Only water and water.
- Damn it.

82
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,404
- Only water and water.
- Damn it.

83
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,649
I forgot my cigarettes.
Have you got any?

84
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,524
Władek probably has.

85
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,766
Thanks.

86
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,284
- Give me one, too.
- You're too young, Button.

87
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,131
- How do you call him?
- Button.

88
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,401
When he was a kid, I had to do
his buttons all the time.

89
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,127
- Very funny. Give me a fag.
- Doctors don't smoke.

90
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,608
- But students can.
- Mum asked me to take care of you.

91
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,164
- She asked me, too.
- You can't forbid me to smoke.

92
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,762
There's nothing about it
in the rules. Give me a fag.

93
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,687
You can forbid him to smoke
as his father.

94
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,965
- Surely, cavalry captain.
- I don't feel like smoking any more.

95
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,001
"FORBIDDEN FOR THE POLES"

96
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,126
- He said: Ryszkowski.
- When?

97
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,086
Two hours ago. Standartenfuhrer
Keller decided to check this.

98
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,523
That's why he called...
he invited you to come.

99
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,204
Major Halbe, do you remember me?

100
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,764
Leave us alone.

101
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,527
- Herr Ryszkowski.
- It's me. I see you were promoted.

102
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,410
- Do you still ride a horse?
- No I don't.

103
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,490
What a pity! You were
a great competitor.

104
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,762
You too...

105
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,567
- No, I don't smoke.
- I can't give it up.

106
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,847
You were very lucky today.
What's your offer?

107
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,527
You've quoted my name in front
of the firing squad.

108
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,850
Maybe you just didn't want
to finish this war in a stupid way.

109
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,010
As a hostage
killed for some actor's death.

110
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,806
- I wasn't involved in this.
- I know.

111
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,846
It's interesting.

112
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,281
- An officer of the intelligence...
- I'm not one anymore.

113
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,801
Since 1937, is that right?

114
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,730
Sit down.

115
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,680
I have an offer for you.

116
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,010
And our future contacts will depend
on your decision.

117
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,925
Stop!

118
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,086
- What are you doing?
- Are you blind?

119
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,687
- I'm drawing.
- Great.

120
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,043
You're sleeping all the time.
You'd better get ready.

121
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,130
- I'm always ready, dad.
- Dad.

122
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,607
Now you'll call father
“major"

123
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,043
Stop talking. Remember
to stick to me after the drop.

124
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,767
After the drop, brother,
I won't have to time for you.

125
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,851
- I have to visit my fiancées.
- What fiancées?

126
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,569
I don't know, from which to start.
Look.

127
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,210
- Pretty?
- What is this?

128
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,048
Hania and Zosia.

129
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,889
What are you doing?

130
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,481
Do you have
any other photos?

131
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,648
I do, cavalry captain.

132
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,771
Give it to me.

133
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,485
And you?

134
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,325
If you get caught with these photos,

135
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,729
this means a death sentence
for your friends?

136
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,969
- Haven't seen her since war began.
- Neither I saw mine.

137
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,004
- Give it to me.
- I'll do it myself.

138
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,962
Wandzia, are you still up?

139
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,084
Get some warm blanket.

140
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,561
This winter can't come to an end.

141
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,924
- A tone of coal costs 15 thousand!
- But I'm not cold.

142
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,569
Good. Look, I have a new client.
I got him through the caretaker.

143
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,842
- I can see.
- A nice man.

144
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,924
Educated, you know?
He even speaks a bit of Polish.

145
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,802
When I told him, my daughter was
an actor, he was very interested.

146
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,561
- I have to clean it by tomorrow.
- You were to take care

147
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,367
- of the Fishers' kids tonight.
- I just wanted to leave it here.

148
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,445
Here you are.

149
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,968
How do you feel?

150
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,009
It's been 3 years.

151
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,240
- If he was alive, you'd hear from him
- Trying to console me?

152
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,762
You're not the only one,
who lost someone in this war.

153
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,681
You have to live,
meet people, take up something.

154
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,166
Am Ito wash
the German pants?

155
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,926
If it weren't for those pants,
we would die of starvation.

156
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,284
- I know you're doing this for me
- You have a good job.

157
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,960
Your colleagues act.

158
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,721
Should I sign the volkslist,
as my new neighbors did?

159
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,163
- See you in the morning. Go to bed.
- Mum...

160
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,810
Forgive me.

161
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,842
Come in.

162
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,848
Heil Hitler.

163
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,562
Sit down, Martin. I've been
waiting for you.

164
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,331
- Is this Pole your man?
- No.

165
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,845
- How did he know your name?
- We met at a horse riding competition.

166
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,884
Before the war. He was a captain
of a Polish team.

167
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,163
Oh, intelligence.
We'll have him interrogated.

168
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,124
For the time being

169
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,281
treat him well. Until we check
if he is of any use for us.

170
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,963
- I gave him time till tomorrow.
- Since when does the Abwehr tell me,

171
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,767
- what I should do with my prisoners?
- Listen, Gerd.

172
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,170
I've been planning a big operation.
But I needed the right person.

173
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,931
It seems, I've just found him.

174
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,522
You can benefit from this, too.
More than you think.

175
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,124
Yes, it's Keller.

176
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,723
How come, he ﬂed?!

177
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,123
Wandzia it's me!
I've forgotten the keys.

178
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,768
- What is it?
- My daughter...

179
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,691
- She needs to be in hospital!
- What's happened?

180
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,962
She might have poisoned herself.

181
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,802
Why should I help you?

182
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,683
- What's the matter?
- The actor took a poison.

183
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,971
I beg you! We have to take her
to hospital.

184
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,881
Don't butt in. Let them solve
their Polish problems themselves.

185
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,688
Get dressed.

186
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,925
Thank you.

187
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,284
Room number 7.

188
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,609
Doctor!

189
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,606
A new patient has been brought in.
She was trying to poison herself.

190
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,091
It will be all right, you will see.

191
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,802
Good morning. What's the matter?

192
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,843
Doctor, please, save her.

193
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,486
- Are you the family?
- I'm her mother.

194
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,287
My neighbor has a car and a night
permit. He drove Wandzia here.

195
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,926
Hubert Jelonek. Nice to meet you.

196
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,805
- What has she taken?
- I don't know.

197
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,571
- I found this on the table.
- Sister, stomach irrigation.

198
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,685
Please, wait in the corridor.
Please, wait outside.

199
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,044
I had a dream about
St.Veronica.

200
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,722
She said,that Hitler
and the Soviets would be at war.

201
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,968
So, we are of the same opinion.

202
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,970
She said, the Soviets
would beat Hitler.

203
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,924
With what? The ﬂails?

204
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,283
Why? They must have some tanks
or cannons...

205
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,245
Yes, one hundred-person tanks.

206
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,489
One man is inside and the rest
is pushing it.

207
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,126
You should tell jokes more often.

208
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,042
Jesus Christ! Who is this?

209
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,844
Holy Mother...

210
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,249
- It's our boy...
- Stay here with him.

211
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,966
Quiet. Quiet.

212
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,805
Easy, easy.
Don't say anything.

213
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,645
I don't understand the people,
who make an attempt on their life.

214
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,525
She broke down, Mr. Jelonek.

215
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,282
- She couldn't hold on.
- What's the problem?

216
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,289
The war ended.

217
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,526
If you want to survive,
you have to side with the Germans.

218
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,844
But they are bustling about,
teasing them and even shooting.

219
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,485
Damn heroes.

220
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,883
She's all right.
But has to stay for the night.

221
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,844
- Oh, God..
- You see?

222
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,010
It wasn't cyanide... Someone
has swindled her.

223
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,009
Doctor!

224
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,202
You're needed
in room number 16...

225
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,491
- I'm going. Excuse me.
- Thank you.

226
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,645
Shit. Storm, that's all we needed!

227
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,128
Can you see anything?

228
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,446
No...

229
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,523
but we should already be
above Germany.

230
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,610
- How can you tell it?
- Cause it stinks.

231
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,409
- Something's wrong.
- We're changing the course.

232
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,443
- We must be turning back.
- Why? When we've gone so far?

233
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,769
- We've already turned back twice
- Be more positive.

234
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,645
I told you so.

235
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,442
If it's not a leak of patrol,
it is the weather.

236
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,529
Our pilots would do it!

237
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,607
Quiet!

238
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,681
He's safe. He was badly shot
in his lungs. Hardly survived.

239
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,201
- Where should we put him?
- Here.

240
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,927
- What am I to say at the round?
- That you know nothing about it.

241
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,408
I take the blame. You'll get his new
name and address.

242
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,171
What if there's a night inspection?

243
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,681
Pray this will not happen.

244
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,609
Cpt. Karol Ryszkowski, officer of the
Polish Military Intelligence Service.

245
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,088
Gifted, ambitious, intelligent.
He was quickly promoted.

246
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,682
- In 1937 dismissed.
- They let such an ace go?

247
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,441
- He started to drink heavily.
- So what? All the Poles drink.

248
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,326
It's a romantic story.
He was in love with an actor,

249
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,491
- but she left him for another man.
- Every actress is a bitch.

250
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,968
My lady is an actress.

251
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,211
I didn't mean German women.

252
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,644
There's more. He got into debt.
He tried to do shady dealings

253
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,367
on delivery of gas masks for the army
and he came a cropper.

254
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,689
He had a good reputation,
so it was covered up,

255
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,008
but he had to leave the army.

256
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,885
After that, we took
no interest in him.

257
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,004
How come he was
among these hostages?

258
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,641
This just came in. He was
arrested as StanislawJurewicz

259
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,481
during a street raid in Otwock,
where he lived with his sister.

260
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,411
- Is the sister alive?
- I doubt it.

261
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,649
She was taken out
to Auschwitz last year.

262
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,724
Come in!

263
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,049
The prisoner is here,
Herr Standartenfuhrer.

264
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,641
- Bring him in!
- Come in!

265
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,366
Thank you!

266
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,486
Good morning, Herr Ryszkowski.
Excuse me, Herr Jurewicz.

267
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,520
You didn't mention, that you dabble
in underground activity.

268
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,601
You had the whole night to think,
so let us hear it.

269
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,882
What would like to tell us?

270
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,161
We want hard facts.

271
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,882
Let us hear them!

272
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,645
Just say it.

273
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,209
I know nothing.

274
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,607
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

275
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,842
What a pity, you've just lost
your chance.

276
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,329
I really know nothing. I've just
started. And I'm a nobody.

277
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,320
They don't trust me. I've been
assigned to a receiving post

278
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,047
- and get only snatches of information.
- Hard facts.

279
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,844
- Farewell.
- I only know...

280
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,402
where the paradropping
from England is planned.

281
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,086
When?

282
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,764
It's coded in the afternoon
BBC broadcast.

283
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,646
- Where?
- Near Chojnowo.

284
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,564
Come in, please!

285
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,730
- May I?
- Who let you get dressed?

286
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,484
I don't want to occupy a bed.You have
much more serious cases here.

287
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,002
- How do you feel?
- Good, really. I will go home.

288
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,647
Sit down, please. I'll take
your blood pressure.

289
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,808
Doctor...thank you for everything.
Please, take my apologies.

290
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,406
- Apologize to your relatives.
- I don't have relatives.

291
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,123
And your mother?

292
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,371
It's not my business,
why you did it.

293
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,609
But these days you can lose life
everyday,

294
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,805
- so why not start respecting it?
- I have nothing to live for.

295
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,810
Why do you start every sentence
with “I”?

296
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,930
My fiancé died at the beginning
of the war.

297
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,088
When the war started I had a husband
and two suns. Now I'm alone.

298
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,165
Have they died?

299
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,210
I don't know. I haven't heard
from them.

300
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,321
But you think they are alive.

301
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,971
For the time being, I try to think
about those, who are alive.

302
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,406
My job is not as responsible as yours.
I'm an actress. I'm completely useless.

303
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,207
Again, this“I." It's war.
We are all fighting.

304
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,528
I'm no good.

305
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,281
This is how the Warsaw streets
look like today. It's Marszalkowska.

306
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,725
All the streets have German names.

307
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,644
Apart from the traditional means
of transport, like trains and trams,

308
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,650
there are now also barrows

309
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,605
and rickshaws.

310
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,929
- This means of transport is...
- What a torture.

311
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,523
- It's the tenth time we see it.
- You think you know everything?

312
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,489
You're dangerous.

313
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,607
This is ghetto, separated from
the rest of Warsaw with a high wall.

314
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,489
All of its inhabitants
have to wear bands

315
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,241
with a star of David
on their right arm.

316
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,001
Will they be issuing passes?

317
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,682
What do you need a pass for?
Where do you want to go?

318
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,121
I have to meet Jane.

319
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,606
- And what about Betty?
- Betty?

320
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,204
Betty is the past.

321
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,608
Jane has so incredible dimples
above her buttocks...

322
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,123
Such a thing I saw only
with Polish women,

323
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,766
but never with the English ones.

324
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,442
Quiet, please! I know your thoughts
are in Poland.

325
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,769
I know, it's boring,

326
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,885
- but this is so called...
- ...Consolidation of knowledge.

327
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,121
These are legal coins
and notes:

328
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,449
one zloty, two zlotys,
fifty zlotys,

329
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,242
100 zlotys, so called miller s wife
and 500 zlotys.

330
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,523
I've never had a miller's wife.

331
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,041
That's all for today.
See you tomorrow.

332
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,811
Lieutenant, reporting with an order
from the command-in-chief I

333
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,525
We are ﬂying!

334
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,763
See you, professor!

335
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,362
- Chojnow, isn't it?
- Yes.

336
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,048
- So, we've got them.
- This is my present for you.

337
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,447
I spoon-fed you with this drop.

338
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,807
- And what's your gain?
- I only want Ryszkowski.

339
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,206
He'sjust a small fry.

340
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,281
But soon, thanks to me, he will be
the most important person there.

341
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,125
What's this?

342
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,802
My technicians have spent all night
preparing this.

343
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,923
A masterpiece.

344
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,842
- A fake order of general Sikorski.
- Has Berlin given you a consent?

345
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,682
Trust me, soon you'll receive
the Iron Cross in Berlin.

346
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,163
Czeslaw Sienny, construction worker.

347
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,010
Repeat, please!

348
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,249
Czeslaw Sienny...

349
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,607
- construction worker.
- Good morning.

350
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,486
- How is your day? Any new arrivals?
- Yes. Here.

351
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,641
Czeslaw Sienny... What brings him
to our humble abode?

352
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,323
At work a metal bar perforated the lung
We've operated on him.

353
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,201
Sister, take off the dressing
from the wound.

354
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,370
I changed it this morning.
Before breakfast.

355
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,249
In spite of this, change
the dressing.

356
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,127
- I'm having a very heavy duty.
- How long

357
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,086
will you risk our patents life,
and the lives of all of us?

358
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,602
It's war. Other people are risking
their lives for you.

359
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,202
You are irresponsible,
you disregard my orders.

360
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,641
I won't let you do it.

361
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,287
Are you going to be shit scared
because of every damned Boche?

362
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,246
I'm not going to do it.
Anything else? I want to go.

363
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,161
From now on I forbid you hiding
the wounded in my ward.

364
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,603
- This is my official directive.
- And what if I refuse?

365
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,882
Marysia, please.

366
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,605
They'll take him as soon as they
find an accommodation for him.

367
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,609
Remember, nothing personal
and nothing English.

368
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,482
- I never get fashionable clothes.
- Your new IDs.

369
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,969
The first names aren't changed.
Krawczyk Czeslaw.

370
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,410
Markowski Jan.

371
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,168
Oleksinski Bronisław.

372
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,529
Rylski Władyslaw.

373
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,690
Bonecki Michal.

374
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,250
You have to take this as well.

375
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,806
Oh my.

376
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,405
We were to be paratroopers,
but get to be a Swiss bank.

377
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,326
Here you have some change.

378
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,126
And cyanide.
As usual, hide it in a collar.

379
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,126
Władek...

380
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,570
I'd rather hide a chewing gum.

381
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,487
Władek!

382
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,963
But I won't take my own life
by myself.

383
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,241
Notes and coins go to the belts.

384
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,327
This is London. Here's the news
from the front line.

385
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,889
Polish submarine ORP ”Sokół” set sail
for her first battle patrol.

386
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,890
- Now?
- Yesterday was the first air-raid

387
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,802
<i>to strike Berlin. 130 bombers
took part in it.</i>

388
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,927
Among them, two Polish squadrons -
No. 300, "Land of Masovia"

389
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,808
and No. 301, Polish Bomber Squadron -
'The Warsaw Protectors'!

390
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,207
We'll end with "The Lancers
arrived at my window”

391
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,609
- Is it this?
- Yes, it is.

392
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,765
Tonight there's going to be a drop.

393
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,442
Set out. The area has to be
surrounded within a radius of 10 km.

394
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,722
We wait for an operation for weeks,
and then get an airplane every day.

395
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,163
- You talk too much.
- I have no objective reservations.

396
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,966
- Say it in a normal way.
- I beg your pardon?

397
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,891
He speaks like some aristocrat.

398
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,361
- And what would you prefer?
- Something normal.

399
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,605
Otherwise, I'll jump in the sea.

400
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,289
- What are you doing, Wandzia?
- I'm walking.

401
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,847
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

402
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,246
Can I go out for a moment?
I have to register food cards.

403
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,968
Are you afraid, that I would
poison myself again? No, I won't.

404
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,962
Bronek wouldn't want this.

405
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,769
- Wandzia, maybe he is alive.
- No, he isn't.

406
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,162
He's gone.
Leave me alone, please.

407
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,245
How is it?

408
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,329
Conditions are great.
We'll probably jump today.

409
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,527
Don't be so glad. Who knows
what will happen above Germany.

410
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,883
- Władek, will open a vent then?
- What for?

411
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,242
I'll piss into Adolf's soup.

412
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,763
Herr Standartenfuhrer, 3 partisans
from the drop zone are dead,

413
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,406
6 arrested.The area
has been surrounded.

414
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,208
- Good. Show us these partisans.
- This way! Follow me, please!

415
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,646
Open up!

416
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,327
- Hold a light!
- A torch!

417
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,488
- Do your job.
- Yes, sir!

418
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,729
You probably overrate your
opponents, Martin.

419
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,083
Your plan seems like firing
a gun at sparrows.

420
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,325
We've been hit!

421
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,203
It's the engine!

422
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,202
We're nosediving.
They'll try to extinguish the fire!

423
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,964
Hold on, Button!

424
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,646
Hold on!

425
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,367
- What did he say?
- We'll manage!

426
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,641
Sure.

427
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,330
- We are ready!
- Set the fire!

428
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,246
Gentlemen...

429
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,447
we are in Poland.

430
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,161
Herr Standartenfuhrer, reporting
readiness for the action.

431
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,646
Thank you.

432
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,966
Pray this time none escapes,
for you know, what will happen to you.

433
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,161
Yes, sir!

434
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,164
They are ﬂying

435
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,448
See you down, gentlemen!

436
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,042
